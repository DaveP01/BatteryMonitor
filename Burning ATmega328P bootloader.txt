Burning the bootloader to my Lipo checker board.
I've tested this using the Arduino Mega 2560 dev board as the ISP

Note that C7 has to either be jumpered or a temporary solder blob to connect DTR from the edge pin to the chip.
Components that need to be loaded are:
C1, C6, R4, R3(This one may not be required), oscillator.

1. Connect Arduino Mega to your PC. Open Arduino IDE.

2. Select Arduino Mega in Tools > Board > Arduino AVR Boards.

3. Open the ArduinoISP sketch from the menu bar:

4. Windows/Linux: File > Examples > 11.Arduino ISP > ArduinoISP

5. Upload the sketch.

6. Disconnect Arduino Mega from your PC.

Connect the boards as follows:

PROGRAMMER PINS				TARGET PINS
PIN 10						RESET
PIN 51						MISO (On my board it's incorrectly marked as MOSI)
PIN 50						MOSI (On my board it's incorrectly marked as MISO)
PIN 52						CLK
5V							5V
GND							GND
10uF capacitor from GND to RESET on the MEGA

7. Connect Arduino Mega to your PC again.

8. Select Arduino Pro or Pro Mini in Tools > Board > Arduino AVR Boards.

Select Arduino as ISP in Tools > Programmer.

Select Tools > Burn Bootloader.

Wait for the process to finish. When it's complete, avrdude done. Thank you. will be printed to console.

Disconnect it all and reload BMP_Graphics to the MEGA
